A simple JavaScript powered turn based game. The user will be prompted to enter the name of their fighting robot. They will then enter the first round of fighting were they will be prompted to either FIGHT or SKIP, fighting will cause them to lose health each turn but if victorious will earn money to use in the store. If they skip a round it costs money which will limit what can be spent on upgrades in the store between rounds. Once they have defeated each robot in the set they will be awarded a score based on the amount of money they have left at the end of the game in addition to their remaining health.
